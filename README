This directory contains ANN (SW) potential Model Driver
for multiple species.

1. Use of a subset of all the supported species is valid.  For example, if the
   model supports 3 species A, B, and C as listed in the parameter file, the use
   of a single species A (or B or C) or two species A and B (or A and C, or B and C)
   are valid.

2. The functional form has been rewritten from the standard SW functional form
   so as to separate the parameters to avoid inconvenience of using this Model
   Driver. The variable 'epsilon' in the standard SW potential is a dummy variable,
   so it is combined with 'A' and 'lambda'. The 'cutoff' of the standard SW potential
   is determined implicitly by 'cutoff' = 'a*sigma', where 'a' and 'sigma' are
   potential parameters. In this Model Driver, the 'cutoff' is defined explicitly.
   The benefit is that if 'sigma' is updated there is no needed to update 'cutoff'.
   Above all, compared to the standard SW potential, the following redefinitions
   have been made:

   A      := A*epsilon
   lambda := lambda*epsilon
   gamma  := gamma*sigma
   cutoff := a*sigma

   Besides, the three-body parameter 'lambda' follows the below mixing rule:
   lambda_ijk = sqrt(lambda_ij*lambda_ik)

   Finally, it is assumed that the angle 'thetea0' is the same for all three-body
   interactions.

   Consequently, the SW Driver for multiple species can be written as:

   E = sum_{i,j>i} phi_2(rij) + sum_{i, j!=i, k>j} phi_3(rij, rik, theta)

   phi_2(rij) = Aij*(Bij(rij/sigma_ij)^(-p) - (rij/sigma_ij)^(-q))
                * exp(sigma_ij/(rij - cutoff_ij))

   phi_3(rij,rik,theta) = sqrt(lambda_ij*lambda_ik)(cos[theta] - cos[theta0])^2
                          * exp(gamma_ij/(rij - cutoff_ij) + gamma_ik/(rik - cutoff_ik))


3. One parameter file is needed, and it follows the format:

   first line: number of species

   Then each line lists two species and 9 parameters for the interaction between the
   two species:

      species1 species2 A B p q sigma lambda gamma costheta_0 cutoff

   where, species1 and species2 are valid KIM API particle species string;
   A and lambda in [eV];
   sigma, gamma, and cutoff in [Angstrom];
   others are unitless.
